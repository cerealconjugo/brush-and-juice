CHANGELOG **v 4.0**

**Blocks**
- Added **Cake**, tweaked some colors to match the new item sprite.


**Items**
- Added **Glow Berries**, reshape and little tweaks to the palette
- Added **Crossbow**, replaced the arrow to look like the new re-sprite one.
- Added **Bell**, parity with the model I guess.
- Added **Redstone Torch**, backported 1.21.2 torch and changed for parity with the previous design.
- Added **Gold Nugget**, parity with the ingot palette.
- Added **Iron Nugget**, minor tweaks.
- Added **Cake**, tweaked colors (inspired by Bountiful Cocoa Cake texture!).


**Entities**
- Tweaked **Chests**, tweaked all chest opened texture. I think it looks pretty.


**GUI**
- Added **Effect background** , tweaks to design and palette.


**Retouched**
- Tweaked **Egg**, added little darker shadow to add contrast.
- Tweaked **Toasts**, further tweaks to the design and palette. Mostly consistency and colors.
- Tweaked **Crafting Table**, mayor tweaks. 
- Tweaked **Apple leaf**, tweaks to the leaf palette and shape.
- Tweaked **Bell**, minor tweaks to the bell entity.
- Tweaked **Barrel Top / Open Top**, slightly tweaks to the palette and added some juice to the inside barrel.
- Tweaked **Item Frame / Glowing Item Frame Items**, a bit of changes that I feel make them look more appealing.
- Tweaked **Item Frame**, change one color... literally.
- Tweaked **Map / filled map**, changed the shape to distinct itself more from the paper texture.
- Tweaked **Paper**, changed the palette to look similar to the banner patterns added in 1.21.2.
- Tweaked **Bone**, tweaks to the shadowing.
- Tweaked **Bread**, less noisy and desaturated. Hopefully it helps to easily understand the shape.

- Remade **Slime Ball**, hopefully this redesign makes the item look lees noisy and more pretty (this is the last time I remade this I promise... or not).
- Remade **Fishing Rod / Carrot on a Stick / Warped Fungus on a Stick**, some changes to the palette and shape, because I wasn't very satisfied with the previous one.
