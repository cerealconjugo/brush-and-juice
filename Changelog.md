CHANGELOG **v 4.0**

**Blocks**

**Items**
- Added **Glow berries**, reshape and little tweaks to the palette
- Added **Crossbow**, replaced the arrow to look like the new re-sprite one.
- Added **Bell item**, parity with the bell model I guess.
- Added **Redstone Torch**, backported 1.21.2 torch and changed for parity with the previous design.

**Entities**
- Tweaked **Chests**, tweaked all chest opened texture. I think it looks pretty.


**GUI**

**Retouched**
- Tweaked **Egg**, added little darker shadow to add contrast.
- Tweaked **Toasts**, further tweaks to the design and palette.
- Tweaked **Crafting Table**, mayor tweaks. 
- Tweaked **Apple leaf**, tweaks to the leaf palette and shape.
- Tweaked **Bell**, minor tweaks to the bell entity.
- Tweaked **Barrel Top / Open Top**, slightly tweaks to the palette and added some juice to the inside barrel.
- Tweaked **Item Frame / Glowing Item Frame Items**, a bit of changes that i feel make them look more appealing.
- Tweaked **Item Frame**, change one color... literally.

- Remade **Slime Ball**, hopefully this redesign makes the item look lees noisy and more pretty (this is the last time I remade this I promise... or not).
- Remade **Fishing Rod / Carrot on a Stick / Warped Fungus on a Stick**, some changes to the palette and shape, because I wasn't very satisfied with the previous one.
- Remade **Bow / Pulling Bow states**, further tweaks to the bow design and palette.
- Remade **Arrow / Tipped Arrow**, mostly palette and shadowing rework.
- Remade **Arrow Entity**, parity with the new arrow design.
