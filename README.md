# brush-and-juice

This pack contains tweaks to a certain vanilla sprites, using similar shapes and colors to the original ones. Its purpose is no other than let myself learn more about texture making.

Mostly a personal pack, any sprite its subject to be changed, removed or remade. I used to make little changes here and there overtime to textures that ive already tweaked.
